        <h4>Workshop description</h4>
        <p>GitHub is an essential part of any developer's toolkit. It provides a safe place to backup unlimited versions of your work, allows others to easily give feedback, promotes collaboration and can also host basic HTML/CSS/JS sites for free.</p>
        <p>In this session we will publish an existing project (or two!) and create a basic portfolio page. We will discuss how Git is used to track projects and how you might integrate it with your class workflow.</p>
        <p>Before the session you will need to create a GitHub account and install the GitHub app on your laptop.</p>
