    For those travelling to the workshops from outside of Christchurch, accommodation is provided at <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/future-students/accommodation/halls-of-residence-and-villages/bishop-julius-hall/">Bishop Julius Hall</a>. We organise all bookings and payments, so all you need to do is turn up! If you require a room with special requirements, we recommended booking at the Academy Motor Lodge (across the road from the workshops), however we currently cannot cover the cost of these bookings.

  <h3>Information for those staying at Bishop Julius Hall</h3>

  <p>
    If you are arriving at the beginning of a day, please do not check into your accommodation but come straight to the workshops. We will look after your bags in a secure room and have them transported to the hall for you to pick up in the evening. At the end of the day you can head over to the Bishop Julius Hall office and receive your room key. Wireless internet is also available.
