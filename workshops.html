  <h3 id="programming-workshops">Programming Workshops</h3>

  <h4>Just for starters</h4>
  <p>For those with absolutely no experience, programming concepts are taught gently using Scratch and Python at the same time. Intended for those with no programming experience, this session will mainly orient you around what is available, and give information on how to get up to speed in programming.</p>

  <h4>Crash course in Python</h4>
  <p>For those who are ready to take on a text based programming language, this session will take you through an introduction to Python to the point where you have written a working program. Programming takes weeks to learn properly, but this will give you a good idea of what is involved, and pointers to what to do next to become confident with the language.</p>

  <h4>Level 2 &amp; 3 Databases</h4>
  <p>If you don't need help with programming, but would like to look at databases (which fall under the Information Systems strand), this session will cover important parts of achievement standard 2.41 (AS91368): "designing and constructing a database" with a well-organised table structure, relational database design, "using tools of the software to integrate data from a database..." The second session (on Thursday) will cover 3.41 (AS91633):  "creating queries which combine data from multiple tables" (joins in SQL), and "creating queries which insert, update or delete to modify data" (CRUD). In addition to these we can discuss assessment criteria, examples and resources available to help teach databases to High School students.</p>

  <h4>Programming 2D Games with JavaScript</h4>
  <p>CodeAvengers have developed a new lessons in which students build 2D graphical games as they learn the computer programming concepts for 1.46-3.46. In this workshop, you will cover how to teach and assess 1.46 using the Code Avengers level 1 game development lessons. There may be an opportunity to move onto an overview of the level 2 and 3 game development courses. Teachers will get to build a couple of their own games during the session. These lessons are also suitable for digital media, or junior programming courses. Please bring headphones to this workshop to hear game sounds (this is optional).</p>
