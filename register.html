  <p>
    Registrations will be sent out to those on the waiting list in August 2015 (<a href="#waitlist">add your name to the waitlist here</a>). Funded places in this event are limited and first-in first-served so please add yourself to the waitlist as early as possible. It's ok to fine-tune parts of registration later e.g. changing the exact number of nights you'll be staying, contact <a href="mailto:jack.morgan@canterbury.ac.nz">Jack Morgan</a> if you need to change your registration.
